Meta description formula 

imo anything under 158 characters is key to good SEO

websites with long names may have an issue*

My formula is pretty much meant for medium/short domain names and
site names, to me it keeps it professionally clean. 

It works for me, so hopefully it will work for you. 

Hope you enjoy!

formula 

[store name] [hyphen] [browse/buy] 
[why choose your store] can include [domain] and/or [discount]
